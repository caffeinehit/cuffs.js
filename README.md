# Cuffs.js

## Dependencies

Cuffs.js relies on [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) and its
[Optimizer](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html)

## Installation

```bash
cd cuffs && cake build
```

This places two minified JavaScript files into the `build/` directory.
One includes RequireJS and the other is a standalone version of Cuffs.
